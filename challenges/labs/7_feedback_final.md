Describe the boot camp: was it useful, difficult, simple?

	The class was not easy, but it was extremely usefull. Can say one of the best and possibley the best I've seen.

Which topic was least familiar to you? Which topic was most familiar?

	Least familiar: working with GitHub and AWS, securing hadopp using kerberos and sentry
	Most familiar: CDH deployment

Which topic did you feel was most helpful? Which topic was not useful, if any?

	Most helpful: CDH Security, resource management
	Least usefull: Creating custom dash boards. I would spend more time and possibly would add one more lab 
		on resources specifically on CDH planning acctivities with a customer. The example of such lab could be: 
		Based on the customer input, plan the CDH cluster for the customer. Suggest services nodes lay out,
		basic contrainer and resource allocations settings and explain why. That would give us an idea 
		what it is like working with specific (or may be even real) use case

How long before you are ready to to install a production cluster by yourself? What do you need to work on?
	I feel that I'm comfortable starting CDH production deployments

	With that said here is the items I think I need and will be working on:
		Re-do last NYC challange
		Learn more about Kerberos
		Kerberos and Open LDAP
		AD integration
		Deploy CM and CDH utilizing PostgreSQL database (including all possble modes: remote, HA/replicated)
```
